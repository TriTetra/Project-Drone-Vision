    "To read from a file, you pass the file path to `cv2.VideoCapture()`.\n",

    "The core logic is a `while` loop that continuously calls `cap.read()`. This method returns two values:\n",
    "1.  `ret`: A boolean that is `True` if a frame was successfully read, and `False` otherwise (e.g., at the end of the video).\n",
    "2.  `frame`: The actual image data for that frame (as a NumPy array).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `cv2.waitKey()` inside the loop to create a small delay, which controls the playback speed. `cv2.waitKey(25)` creates a 25ms delay, corresponding to a playback speed of roughly 40 FPS (1000ms / 25ms = 40)."
